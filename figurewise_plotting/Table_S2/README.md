The code 'curve_fitting.R' usues the dataset 'dataset_for_curve_fitting.csv' to estimate the parameters given in table 2 in supplementary information.

The dataset 'dataset_for_curve_fitting.csv' has the following columns:

1. f_dist_interbush - distance (in cm) moved by a female across bushes in 10 mins (10 mins equals 1 timestep in the simulation)

2. m_dist_interbush - distance (in cm) moved by a male across bushes in 10 mins (10 mins equals 1 timestep in the simulation)

3. calling_effort - proportion of time spent calling within a night (see Torsekar and Balakrishnan, 2020) for more details.

4. m_dist_within_bush - distance (in cm) moved by a male within a bush in 10 mins (10 mins equals 1 timestep in the simulation)


4. f_dist_within_bush - distance (in cm) moved by a female within a bush in 10 mins (10 mins equals 1 timestep in the simulation)

5.bush width  - diameter (in cm) of Hyptis suaveolens (host plant) bushes in the field (see Torsekar and Balakrishnan, 2020).
