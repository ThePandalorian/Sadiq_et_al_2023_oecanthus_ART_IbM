The names of each folder corresponds directly to the figure numbers or table numbers as indicated in the manuscript and the supplementary information. The data file needed to run the code is also provided in the same folder for convenience (note that this leads to quite a bit of redundancy, since several figures use the same dataset).
 
Each folder contains relevant datasets and Rscripts to visualise the plots or to realise the values in the table_S2. 

The response variable in all figures (except Fig_S5) is mating success and each value of this variable is a mean of 100 simulation runs.

For Fig_S5, the response variable is the random movement propensity and each value of this variable is a mean of 100 simulation runs.
